1. Get current year
2. Calculate if leap year. If yes, set February days to 29, else 28.
  To determine whether a year is a leap year, follow these steps:
    If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.
    If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
    If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
    The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).
    The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).
3. Array of months = [January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December]
4. Array of days of the month = [ 31, FebDays, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 ]
5. Array of days of the week = [ Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday ]
6. Calculate what day of the week the month starts on based on today's date (get current date, get current day)


today's date -1, modulo 7.
take that number and subtract today's date number from it.
if it's greater than 0, subtract 7.
get absolute value. that's the day the month starts on.

- if today is Sunday the 18th of October...

  use modulo to find remainder after todays' date is divided by 7

  18-1 = 17. 17 % 7 = 3.
  subtract today's day number. 3-0 = 3.
  if it's greater than 0, subtract 7.
  3-7 = -4
  get absolute number and it's thursday.
